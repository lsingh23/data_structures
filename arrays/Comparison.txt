               StudentContainer(array)   V/s      StudentContainer(LinkedList)
               
Adding a new student object in LinkedList is easy as compared to  adding a new student object in the    
StudentConatiner that is built using an array because we don't have to worry about checking the size of the 
container when we are dealing with LinkedList.We don't need to ensure Capacity before adding an object in the 
container in case of LinkedList.Also , we have the option to  add the elements always at the head using a Linked
List which is O(1) and makes the adding process faster than in case of array which is O(n).

StudentContainer using array can also have some advantages over LinkedList container.For example, get(int index)
method in array container gives the ability to get the access to the element specified at any index in the array.
while this becomes really  complex function in case of a LinkedList version.
